I have decided to do Financial Planning for a purpose. Many people especially teenagers did not know how to plan their money. Just like my friends they often don't know how they spend their money so fast because they think they didn't even spend it that much. So often times they can't achieve their goal. The https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/when-it-comes-to-their-financial-future-most-americans-are-winging-it.html had said "75 percent of Americans are rejecting financial help and that can be a disaster." This shows without the help of financial planning people often just checks every time and ended up with not enough money to pay. Learning financial. I would like to make a website for those young adult or people that gonna start a life by them self for example, college student to how to achieve their goal from financial planning. In addition, my website can also help people who want to start a business with no experience, but doesn't have enough money yet.
